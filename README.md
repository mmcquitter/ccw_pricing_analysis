# An Analysis of the Pricing Carl's Car Wash

## Summary

Carl's Car Wash is the most famous car wash in the Super Simple universe.  One customer even traveled back through time to clean their time machine! However, what I want to know is: How consistent is his pricing strategy? Customers pay for car washes via tokens, conveniently counted by 1s, 2s, 3s, 5s, etc. From my observation, I have the suspicion that Carl's pricing is messy (punny, huh?).  To get to the bottom of this I will apply the steps below, editing as I go, and figure out if Carl's pricing needs to be cleanded up (hehe, again!).  I'll continue to document in this read me.  Hope you have as much fun exploring this project as I am developing it.
